# About this project

I found this public api from Studio Ghibli: https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/films, which returns all the movies and some related data, like rotten tomatoes score.
Unfortunately, this api doesn't return the poster images, so i did it. You can find the modified api on my repository: https://github.com/tilucast/Studio-Ghibli-API (Node REST folder.) 

After installing the dependencies, run **yarn dev / npm run dev** to start the server, and make a request to **http://localhost:3333**.
